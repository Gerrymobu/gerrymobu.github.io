									<h1>Rubik´s Cube Robot Solver </h1>
									<p>One of the most pivotal aspects of my professional profile is the integration of automated systems, from design inception to implementation. This project exemplifies this capability magnificently. The concept of devising a mechanized system fully autonomous in solving a Rubik's cube underscores my prowess as an engineer and showcases my ability to develop comprehensive systems regardless of complexity.</p>

								<p>The steps to be undertaken are straightforward. Initially, the system characteristics were defined, commencing with a minimum requirement of five stepper motors and minimal wiring. This was achieved through an integrated system approach, wherein a base plate was designed to house the stepper motor controllers, complemented by a 24-volt power supply and a sleek, ergonomic design.</p>
								<p>Finally, the Arduino software was employed to program the resolution logic, which is encapsulated within a state machine sequence. This entails recording the initial state and applying a pre-established algorithm based on Rubik's cube solving patterns. Through this methodical approach, desired states are achieved, allowing for the continuation of sequences until the puzzle is fully resolved.</p>

								<p>In conclusion, this project has exemplified the seamless integration of engineering principles and innovative problem-solving techniques to develop a fully autonomous Rubik's cube solving system. From defining system requirements to designing and implementing integrated hardware and software components, every aspect has been meticulously executed to achieve optimal performance. The utilization of stepper motors, a clean and ergonomic design, and the implementation of Arduino software demonstrate a holistic approach to engineering excellence. This project not only showcases technical proficiency but also underscores the ability to tackle complex challenges with precision and ingenuity. Moving forward, the lessons learned from this project will serve as a foundation for future endeavors, driving continued advancements in automation and robotics.</p>
