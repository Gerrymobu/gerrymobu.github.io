									<h1>IDEEA Smart Mobility </h1>
									<p>The rapid pace of societal and urban development necessitates a reevaluation of transportation systems, especially in burgeoning mega-cities where overcrowding exacerbates existing challenges. Traditional modes of transportation struggle to meet the evolving needs of urban dwellers, particularly in facilitating the movement of goods alongside people. This congestion not only contributes to environmental pollution but also strains delivery services, impacting the well-being of workers. To conceptualize a future mobility solution for urban areas, it should be closely oriented towards the users' needs and seamlessly integrated into big cities' infrastructure.</p>

								<div class="image main"><img src="images/IDEEA.png" alt="" /></div>
								<p>This project embodies an international collaboration, wherein a diverse team comprising individuals from various nationalities has converged with a unified objective: to design the most optimal method of sustainable transportation. Beyond the exchange of technical ideas, this endeavor has been enriched by the fusion of linguistic competencies, allowing for effective communication across different languages. Throughout this endeavor, we have fostered an environment of mutual understanding and collaboration, blending cultures and perspectives to achieve our shared engineering goal.</p>
								<p>In response, our team proposes the DeliBot, an automated delivery robot integrated into a novel ecosystem designed to streamline deliveries while prioritizing worker welfare. Our comprehensive plan outlines both short-term and long-term strategies for implementation, showcasing a vision where technology enhances efficiency without compromising human dignity. Through meticulous project management and engineering processes, we present a solution poised to redefine urban logistics and improve quality of life in future mega-cities.</p>

								<p>DeliBot is a mobility device made to help
									delivery workers from overworking. Basically, it has a platform in the middle and two smart wheels
									attached on the side of it. Wheels are designed to climb up the stairs or get over obstacles on the
									ground. And the platform has boundaries on four sides looking like a box. In addition, the flap is
									attached to safely drop off the packages to your house. Detailed design and engineering process will
									be explained throughout next chapters. Following chart shows the parts installed inside the platform
									and the wheel.</p>

									<p>Throughout this project, I've navigated the intricacies of the design process alongside international peers. Communication within our group, essential in any collaborative effort, presented unique challenges due to diverse cultures, languages, and perspectives. However, we quickly recognized the value of these differing viewpoints, which fostered a balance between design aesthetics and engineering pragmatism. One significant hurdle we faced was refining our target audience and identifying optimal areas for improvement. Initially focusing on students and workers proved overly broad, leading us to pivot towards a more specific demographic: delivery drivers. This shift enabled us to better address particular needs and desires, emphasizing the importance of focused problem-solving. Despite the vast time zone differences, our team maintained communication through regular Zoom meetings, supplementing these with smaller discussions to enhance organization and idea generation. Embracing varied perspectives and harnessing our collective expertise, we iteratively refined our designs, ultimately overcoming challenges to develop the innovative and efficient DeliBot.<p></p>
