									<h1>SLB Downtime reduction </h1>
									<p>Downtime stands as a critical performance metric within CMPU's production floor, where meticulous analysis and control are paramount to mitigate its adverse impact on efficiency and utilization levels, indicative of departmental underperformance. Consequently, this project proposes a data-driven analysis to discern trends and unfavorable patterns contributing to indirect labor hours. My aim in this endeavor is to showcase how my strategic action plan effectively mitigated these challenges, substantiated by empirical evidence demonstrating tangible improvements.</p>

								<p>Within the project, the methodology entailed an initial phase of pinpointing weaknesses, characterized by the comprehensive collection of data spanning six previous months. Subsequently, a meticulous analysis was conducted to discern trends and distributions, thereby facilitating the identification of overarching patterns within the dataset. Armed with this insight, a strategic action plan was formulated and implemented to address identified issues effectively.</p>

								<p>Upon obtaining this information, the action plan was set in motion. Over the subsequent months, the methodology described previously was consistently applied. Each day, I assumed responsibility for analyzing the previous day's shift clock-ins, providing feedback and justifications for any discrepancies the following day.</p>
							<p>A forecast is proposed of monthly hours based on an in-depth analysis of personnel allocation by area and historical trends from previous months. Furthermore, we anticipate potential events that could lead to increased downtime. This analytical approach enables us to pinpoint instances of downtime and devise strategic interventions to mitigate underlying causes.</p>

							<p>In conclusion, this project has been a testament to the value of meticulous analysis and strategic planning in optimizing operational efficiency within CMPU's production floor. Through comprehensive data collection, trend analysis, and proactive measures to address downtime, we have demonstrated a commitment to continuous improvement. By leveraging insights gained from this project, we are poised to implement targeted interventions that will further enhance productivity and performance in the future.</p>
