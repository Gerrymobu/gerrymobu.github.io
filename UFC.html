									<h1>UFC</h1>
									<p>Utilizing the CRISP-DM methodology, the objective of this project is to analyze a dataset of UFC fights to develop prediction models that estimate the outcome of future matchups.</p>
								</header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/UFC.png" alt="" /></div>
								<p>This data science project focuses on UFC fights, sourcing data from matchups across various weight classes from 1993 to 2021. The dataset provides detailed information on the pre-fight and in-fight dynamics, encompassing 135 variables.</p>
								<p>The next step that i needed to continue was the data segmentation which was made with the following criteria:</p>
								<p>-Weight Division segmentation</p>
								<p>-Errase records before 2010</p>
								<p>-Errase incomplete records</p>
								<p>-PCA</p>
								<p>-Standard deviation analysis</p>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/UFC 2.png" alt="" /></div>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/Variables relevantes.png" alt="" /></div>
								<p>Then we get to the modelation process where the cirteria is:</p>
								<p>Model Performance Evaluation: Utilize evaluation metrics such as accuracy, recall, or F1-score to measure the model's performance in predicting UFC fight outcomes.</p>
							<p>Cross-Validation: Employ cross-validation techniques to assess the model's generalization ability and prevent overfitting.</p>
							<p>Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimize the model's hyperparameter values to enhance its performance.</p>
<p>Model Training: Adjust the model parameters using the training dataset to achieve a good fit to the data.</p>
<p>Modeling Algorithm Selection: Choose the most suitable machine learning algorithm for the UFC prediction problem.</p>

<p>After extensive analysis and modeling, this project has culminated in a comprehensive exploration of UFC fight data, employing advanced data science techniques to predict fight outcomes. Through the application of the CRISP-DM methodology, we have navigated through the intricate landscape of UFC matchups, spanning different weight classes and spanning nearly three decades of competition history. 

	Our journey began with meticulous data preprocessing, where we curated a rich dataset containing detailed information on pre-fight and in-fight dynamics. Leveraging this dataset, we ventured into the realm of machine learning, where we trained and evaluated various models to predict fight results. Utilizing metrics such as accuracy, recall, and F1-score, we assessed the performance of our models and fine-tuned them to achieve optimal predictive power.
	
	Cross-validation techniques were instrumental in ensuring the generalization ability of our models and guarding against overfitting. Through rigorous experimentation and hyperparameter tuning, we optimized our models to strike a balance between complexity and performance. 
	
	One of the key strengths of our approach lies in its adaptability. As we encountered challenges and limitations, we iteratively refined our methodology, incorporating additional features and exploring alternative algorithms to enhance model performance. This iterative process of improvement underscores our commitment to rigor and excellence in data-driven analysis.
	
	In conclusion, this project represents a significant step forward in the application of data science to sports analytics, demonstrating the potential of predictive modeling in the realm of combat sports. While our models provide valuable insights into UFC fight prediction, they also serve as a foundation for further research and exploration in this exciting field. As the UFC continues to evolve, so too will our methodologies and approaches, ensuring that we remain at the forefront of predictive analytics in sports.</p>
