									<h1>Roland Garros </h1>
									<p>The most prestigious tennis tournament in France intersects with the realm of data science, illuminating how this discipline serves as a valuable tool for analyzing tournament information, results, and matches played since 1970. Leveraging this extensive database, a CRISP-DM methodology was employed to develop a predictive model aimed at maximizing accuracy.</p>
								</header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/Roland.png" alt="" /></div>
								<p>Our database underwent a thorough cleansing process to retain only the pertinent variables for the matches to be predicted. Subsequently, a new variable, referred to as 'prediction,' was created. This variable serves as the target for prediction, with the values '1' indicating Player A's victory and '0' denoting Player B's victory.</p>
							<p>In our training dataset, a variable was created incorporating both the player's ranking and points. It is of paramount significance to note that within the predictive database, missing data were present. Consequently, these data were manipulated through the introduction of a novel variable, affording greater significance to players with more available data, thereby favoring their predictive efficacy for winning outcomes.</p>
								<p>Following these procedures, we employed the Promidat tool, specifically the predictor module, to input our data and derive correlations among variables. Subsequently, we iteratively tested various models to determine the most fitting one for our purposes.</p>
									<div class="image main"><img src="images/Roland 2.png" alt="" /></div>
									<p>Here we present a comparison of all models, and the one chosen for implementation is the Lasso penalized regression. This model exhibited the highest indices of '1's, which is of utmost importance as they indicate the winning player.</p>
									<div class="image main"><img src="images/Roland 3.png" alt="" /></div>
									<p>Once the model to be used was determined, we proceeded to run it alongside our training data in the predictor tool. After generating and running the model on our database for prediction, it yielded the results displayed in the attached Excel file. These results were then interpreted to visually identify the winner's name.</p>
							<p>Having as final result 80% of correct estimated match results</p>
							<p>This project underscores the potent synergy between data science methodologies and sports analytics, as exemplified by our exploration of the French tennis tournament dataset. Through meticulous data cleaning, model selection, and predictive analysis, we have demonstrated the efficacy of machine learning techniques in forecasting match outcomes. The adoption of the Lasso penalized regression model further solidifies our commitment to precision and accuracy, yielding insightful predictions for player performance. Moving forward, this project not only contributes to our understanding of tennis dynamics but also highlights the transformative potential of data-driven approaches in sports analytics.</p>
